# Control Theory

- The user's request is the Setpoint (SP)
- The system's current state is the Process Variable (PV)
- Your decisions are the Controller minimizing the error between SP and PV
- Agent responses and Aligner verification are the Feedback Loop
- ALWAYS verify after execution using the appropriate method (see Post-Execution rules)
